# AutomatedLab-Scripts-
My own AutomatedLab Scripts

This is a collection of PowerShell scripts created for use with AutomatedLab.
AutomatedLab enables rapid deployment of test and lab environments with multiple products or just a single VM. There are only two requirements: the DVD ISO image (with product keys) and a Hyper-V host machine.
Usually, a decent workstation with SSD storage and plenty of RAM will suffice. During development of the scripts, a PC with Windows 10 and Client Hyper-V was used.
AutomatedLab also provides support for Azure and VMware environments, the scripts however were developed and tested with Hyper-V only.
